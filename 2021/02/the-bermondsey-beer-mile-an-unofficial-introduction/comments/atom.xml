If I was planning to take on the beer mile with a largeish group of friends (maybe 20 people, for a birthday celebration) would we be able to just turn up and pick and choose which bars to go in, or will we need to book?&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve tentatively started organising my brothers stag do and thought the beer mile would be a fun thing to do on it. However after the crap year we&amp;#39;ve all had im wondering if you&amp;#39;ve heard any news about when/if theyre all reopening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stag do wouldnt be until July so there&amp;#39;s plenty of time so fingers crossed. Just wondered if you&amp;#39;d heard any news.&lt;/p&gt;

There is increased noise, antisocial behaviour, danger for young children and a broad cumulative impact from some loud and leery revellers. We are working with businesses and the first order will be to rename it away from the beer mile. Whoever is visiting the area, please show the utmost consideration to residents and keep noise to a minimum. You wouldn&amp;#39;t want to experience what my residents have to ensure. Residents with PTSD, sensory disorders are now under greater medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those that run this site. Nice idea and helpful but I&amp;#39;d respectfully ask you to rename away from the beer mile. Happy to work with you when this area is rebranded. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

Bear in mind a lot of these places are working breweries first, bars second, and they like to take holidays too! Still, each bar is a separate case and will have their own plans. Probably best to check their individual websites and associated social media feeds and see what their plans are.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
