&lt;p&gt;- There was a mix-up on our part between 98 Druid Street (the old home of The Kernel) and 118 Druid Street (currently home of Anspach &amp;amp; Hobday). That&amp;#39;s now been corrected in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>A few comments... Firstly, you don’t mention the words independent or craft anywhere in the article, until you use them...</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.bermondsey-beer-mile.co.uk/fourpure.html">&lt;p&gt;A few comments... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you don’t mention the words independent or craft anywhere in the article, until you use them at the end to describe what, in your opinion, Fourpure aren’t. In addition, as you mention, Hawkes have sold to Brewdog, who have had massive investment from the company who owns Pabst Blue Ribbon. And there are no negatives in your review of them. Just seems a bit contradictory, really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A&amp;amp;H didn’t take over their arch from The Kernel. It’s a different space. Same street, different number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - speaking of the Kernel - to call the experience of going to one of the best breweries in the UK, buying bottles and talking to the people who created them, disturbing - well, I don’t think you could possibly have missed the point any more spectacularly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an embryo of a good idea in what you’ve done, but you need to research better, be consistent - and keep your personal feelings out of it if you’re trying to present it as an information source. &lt;/p&gt;</content>
